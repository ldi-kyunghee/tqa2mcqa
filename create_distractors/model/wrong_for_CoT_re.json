    "raw_output": "First, interpret the question carefully: it asks for the BLEU score of the \"DCGCN single model\" when trained with “0.1M extra parameters.” In this context, “extra parameters” appears to mean additional data used during training, since the table lists different performances based on the amount of external data (all of which are described in M, or millions, of data points), relating such datasets to specific BLEU scores.\n\nReviewing the data in the table, under the \"_BLEU points - training data amount_\", we note entries for DCGCN(single):\n\n- With no external data or unspecified data (in \"# ALL\"): BLEU=25.9.\n- Using 0.1M of additional dataset data, notable BLEU=29.0.\n- When trained with 0.2M of data, BLEU=31.6.\n- With 0.3M data, BLEU=33.2.\n\nHere, \"0.1M extra data\" corresponds to the configuration of training with an additional that's customary for these positions described explicitly as 0.1M, and accurate BLEU score reported: **29.0**. This indicates that the BLEU is associated with the 0.1M evidence that in order to realize this precise earlier \"parameter\" mistake, “extra 0.1M” overall corresponds with the performance value 29.0 as well.\n\nFurthermore, the table specifically states: \"*using additional 0.1M data, the single DCGCN model achieves a BLEU score of 29.0*.\"\n\nTherefore, the BLEU score of the DCGCN single model trained with 0.1M external additional datasets is 29.0.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 29.0",
